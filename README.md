# ARYA UI Coding Test
Thank you for your time to go through my code. If you have any problems encountered during running this app, feel free to contact me.
***Xcode 16.2 and iPhone 16(18.2) simulator are used for development. Support from iOS 15. Only for iPhone devices, portrait mode.***

## Requirements
- [x] All UIs should be as close to design as possible.
- [x] Use native components and adhere to best practices for iOS development.
- [x] Follow clean code principles, ensuring modular and maintainable code.
- [x] Use the provided assets correctly.
- [x] Implement the required interactive elements.

## Tools and Frameworks
1. Xcode
2. Git
3. SwiftUI (most)
4. UIKit (some, for complement)

## Reason why...
### Support from iOS 15
Xcode 16.2 supports natively from iOS 15 as the minimum version, I would like to support more iPhone devices.

### Only support iPhone portrait mode
There is only an iPhone portrait mode design mock-up available.

### Bigger the font sizes of the message texts
I think the font size originating from the CSS file is a bit small in the iPhone, a little bit adjusted.

### Bigger the plus button size
The original plus button size is 14 x 14, not big enough to tap in an iPhone.

### No additional libraries
Keep things simple and fast.

### Have some UIKit code
Some features are not performing well in native SwiftUI (especially in iOS 15), hybrid is the best way to go.
